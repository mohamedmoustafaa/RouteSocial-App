# RouteSocial-App

## 🎯 Description
**RouteSocial-App** is a front-end social media web application built with **React** and **Vite**.  
It allows users to register, log in, create posts, view post details, access their profile, and more.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:**  
> If you see an error like:  
> `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)`

> It comes from the **Back-End API** (authentication or token validation issue).
